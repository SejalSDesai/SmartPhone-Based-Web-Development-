•	Project Details : 

1.	The Giveaway App, integrated with Firebase for data management, is designed to facilitate a seamless buying and selling experience for users. 

2.	The initial step involves setting up a Firebase project and configuring the iOS app to enable secure user authentication, allowing users to register and log in using either email/password or social media credentials. 

3.	The app's core functionality centers around a product listing feature, wherein a Firebase Realtime Database is employed to store product information, including details such as name, description, price, and seller information.

4.	For buyers, the purchase flow is developed to provide a user-friendly interface for selecting and buying a product. 

5.	Upon purchase, the database is updated to reflect the transaction, removing the bought item from the product listing. 

6.	Sellers, on the other hand, can utilize a dedicated interface to post new products and corresponding functions are implemented to update the Firebase database with the new product information.

7.	Sellers benefit from a dedicated dashboard that allows them to manage their listed products and track sales. 

8.	The implementation includes features to mark products as sold and update the seller's inventory, ensuring accurate representation of available items.
